As some of you remember, ENDZONE community came together very strongly when Beirut explosion happened and we raised more than $500 in donations to support those affected. 
We believe that with the current situation in Ukraine, we can come together again and make a positive impact on those who need our help the most - children.

We encourage you to consider helping children and their families affected by the latest events in Ukraine.
