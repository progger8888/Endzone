BASE TAKEOVER EVENT V2  

Sunday, 22.01.22  at 18:00 CET

There is a massive custom build base in Vavilovo on  ENDZONE 2 guarded by heavily geared defenders barricaded inside protecting the precious loot.

The group/player that manages to eliminate the armed defenders and successfully take over the base will get to claim it and keep it for themselves with all the loot inside.

There are multiple gates protecting base that defenders are eagerly watching over. At the start of the event, breaching charges will be placed on each gate allowing you to arm it.

To qualify as winners of the event, the participating group/player will have to replace the ENDZONE base flag with any other flag, and keep the flag up for the next 20 minutes.
If during the 20 minutes base gets invaded, the flag must be lowered and timer resets.

The base is marked on your map, and spawn points have been added within 1.5km of Vavilovo.

Have fun
