To continue with the ENDZONE tradition, last days of 1.16 will end with The Purge base raiding event. 

Do you have any rivals that you wish you were able to raid? Perhaps any hostile neighbors? Or simply achieve sweet revenge? Now is your time to do that. 

Time to bring out the last of the best loot you have and end 1.16 with the bang! 

The Purge starts: 

S1 - Saturday 16th at 3pm GMT
S2 - Sunday 17th at 3pm GMT
S3 - Sunday 17th at 3pm GMT

- Inland spawns
- 400 hacksaws on the map
- 60 ready to go cars on the map

Once The Purge is activated, you will be able to cut base codelocks using hacksaws! During the purge, you will not be able to attach codelocks. 
1 hacksaw can cut 1 codelock.

Keep an eye on the announcements for the updates on what is coming to ENDZONE with 1.17 patch. 
Good luck.
